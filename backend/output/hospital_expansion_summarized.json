    "body": "Hi Sarah, I need to inform you that our structural steel shipment for the Hospital Expansion project has been delayed by approximately one week. The fabricator encountered quality issues during final inspection that required additional testing. We've resolved the issue, but this pushes our delivery date from October 28th to November 4th. This will impact the frame erection schedule for the new wing. I've attached the updated delivery schedule and quality certification documents. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed with adjusting the construction timeline. Best regards, John Martinez, Procurement Manager",

The specification calls for a suspended acoustical ceiling system, but I notice in the construction documents that some areas show exposed structure. Can you confirm which ceiling type applies to the patient rooms on Level 2? Specifically, do we proceed with the suspended acoustical system as specified, or is there a design change? I need this confirmed by Friday to complete the interior elevations. Thank you, Michael Chen, Senior Architect",

    "body": "David, I've identified a coordination issue on the third floor MEP routing. The main supply duct (24\" x 12\") for the ICU section conflicts with a structural beam that runs perpendicular to our duct route. The beam sits at 10' - 6\" AFF, and our duct needs 12\" clearance. The structural drawings show the beam depth as 16\", which doesn't leave adequate space. We have three options: 1) Route the duct around the beam (requires additional elbows and increases static pressure), 2) Lower the duct to 9' - 6\" AFF (violates code clearance requirements), or 3) Request structural modification to provide a pocket or notch. Please advise on the preferred solution. We need resolution by Monday to maintain schedule. Best regards, Lisa Thompson, MEP Lead",

The room prep work can continue as scheduled, but final installation and commissioning will be delayed. I've updated the master schedule document.
