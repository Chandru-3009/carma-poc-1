    "body": "Good morning, I'm writing to inform you about a delay in the delivery of the two primary air handling units (AHU-1 and AHU-2) for the Downtown Office Tower project. The units are currently held at customs due to missing documentation for the imported components. We've been working with customs to resolve this, but it's taking longer than anticipated. The original delivery date was November 2nd, but we now anticipate delivery on November 5th - a delay of three business days. This may impact your MEP installation schedule. I've attached the updated shipping documentation. We're expediting the customs clearance process and will provide daily updates. Apologies for the inconvenience. Best regards, Jennifer Lee, Logistics Manager",
